# Speedrun Route Notes

Route notes for various speedruns intended to help people just getting started.

## Contributing

For now this is just for runs that I know enough about to make docs for, and will hopefully expand as I learn more runs. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR, or message me (@faultyserver) directly if you're not sure how to do that.
